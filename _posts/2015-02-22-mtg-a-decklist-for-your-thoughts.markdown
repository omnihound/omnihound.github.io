Remember Magic: the Gathering? It was that game 'those' guys in high school used to play.  I've always struggled to tell people what its all about.  Saying that its a game where you're a type of wizard called a 'planeswalker', that faces off against other 'planeswalkers' by casting spells and summoning creatures to attack them may have once sounded cool to like minded peers, but I'm not sure that there is a good way to sell it to say, your old school parents or your non-gaming partner.

I guess sometimes, a lot of people try to explain that its like chess - it basically a duel that requires strategy and at the same time an adaptive mindset as the battlefield changes.  Unlike chess though, the battlefields of Magic are constantly shifting and changing rules.  Perhaps the most maligned part of the game is that its a collectable card game.  The publisher of the game, Wizards of the Coast, are releasing new cards for players to accumulate and spend their disposable incomes on.  Money aside though, the idea of the expansions is to add and shift the complexity of the game without really changing the core rules, which is basically a gaming nerd's paradise.

Then you have formats.  You see, you can't simply have 100 of the 'best' card.  The common limit is 4 of a given card with exception of to basic lands (lands are the resource of the game).  Then you mix in banned and restricted lists, as well as allowed playable sets in the format.  For example, standard is a format where only the currently printed sets are allowed.  Limited formats make you think on your toes and forces you to choose cards from a shared/limited pool, making you consider choices you would not usually make.

'Restriction breeds creativity' is a thing that I really like about this game.  Communities come together and sometimes create formats for magic and one that has gained traction recently is 'Tiny Leaders'.  The format is singleton, meaining the quantity limit for non basic land cards is 1. 25 life and a concept of a commander, which was taken from the commander rules.  Also the casting cost (basically the cost to play the card) must not be greater than 3 mana. The idea of what cards can be used in light of these restrictions, and what kind of emergent gameplay comes out of it is fascinating to me, maybe partly cause you can often see cards that don't have alot of monetary worth (its a piece of overpriced cardboard), make some great plays.

Congratulations if you've parsed this post this far, especially if you have no idea what Magic: the Gathering is.  The following is a listing of my tiny leaders list.  Magic has a few basic win conditions.  Planeswalker's start with 20 life (or in the case of tiny leaders, 25), and the first person to have 0 life loses.  Also if a person has to draw but has not enough cards in their deck, they lose.  This list uses poison counters (of which when a player accumulates 10, they lose) as its main win condition.  Older players who have not played in a while might scoff at the mechanic, but assuredly, it was made in to an actual thing in a later block (a block is a group of 3 expansion sets).  Also, this is an excuse to test some new ruby code that parses lists and formats them, I'll probably be mucking around with it more expect the formatting to change a bit.

Is this a great list? It has some pretty good stuff in it, but its probably not the best list by any measure. It was a fun problem fun thinking about the restrictions placed on the format and I hope I get to play with it more.
